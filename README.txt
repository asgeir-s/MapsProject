Android Studio project-template built withe Gradle. The project uses Google Play Services and automaticly running tests when project is built (withe "./gradlew connectedCheck").

When the project is built from Android Studio the tests will not run, but every thing else works.

To run the tests open a console (terminal) root of project and run "./gradlew connectedCheck".

Make sure you have both "Google Repository", and "Android Support Repository"
installed in your SDK using the SDK Manager.
